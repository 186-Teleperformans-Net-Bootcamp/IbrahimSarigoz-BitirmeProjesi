# Comment 

I wrote some code for role based user login. I have completed the admin login but not the user part. <br />
I set the units using enum. <br />
Piece 0, kg 1, lt 2, gram 3.<br />
I used caching in the get function using id.<br />
Due to the problems I experienced at some points, I could not prepare an efficient project, but I tried to develop a project according to Solid principles by following the design patterns as much as I could.
